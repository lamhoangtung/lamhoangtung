Iâ€™m a **Machine Learning Engineer** at [WorldQuant](https://worldquant.com), an industry-leading international hedge fund, and quantitative investment management firm.

Before that, I was the **Co-Founder & CAIO** of a start-up called [Techainer](https://techainer.com), which provides various AI solutions for businesses.

My work is mostly about **Computer Vision**, **MLOps**, and **Performance Optimization**.

I love open source. By looking at my star pattern you can identify what I'm working on. You can also find everything that I open source here on my Github account.

If you want to talk, the best way to contact me is usually through [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lam.hoangtung.69) or [Email](mailto:lamhoangtung.vz@gmail.com).
